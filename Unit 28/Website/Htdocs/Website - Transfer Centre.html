/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

  <h2>Big Clubs will laugh at £25 million Reus fee - Kahn</h2>
  <p>The 25-year-old had the stipulation inserted in his existing deal - which runs until June 2017 - upon signing for BVB from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012.Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City are all rumoured to be interested in the player, while Reus himself has shown little interest in extending his contract.<BR>
    BVB have admitted they will be powerless in the event he decides to depart and ex-Bayern keeper Kahn expects him to do exactly that.        "It will be very difficult for Dortmund to hold on to Reus, especially if we take into account that they are unlikely to qualify for European football,&rdquo; the ex-Bayern goalkeeper told <EM>Sport Bild</EM>.<BR>
    "Dortmund will only be able to hold on to Reus if they push their own financial limits. If not, Reus will definitely walk out.<BR>
    "The big clubs in Europe laugh about a €25m transfer fee these days…"<BR>

  <h2>BREAKING: Arteta signs new Arsenal deal</h2>
  <p>Mikel Arteta has signed a one-year contract extension with Arsenal, according to his agent. Arteta's representative Inaki Ibanez told <EM>footmercato.net</EM>: "Mikel is no longer free next June, because he now has an extra year on his contract." This means Arteta will stay at the Emirates until the end of 2015-16. </p>

  <h2>Gabriel Paulista could make his debut for Arsenal </h2>
  <p>Gabriel Paulista will fast tracked into the Arsenal first team following his arrival from Villarreal and could make his debut on Sunday against Aston Villa. Arsenal have yet to annouce his purchase, but rumours have spread that Paulista could make his debut as soon as this Sunday. </p>
  <h2>Bale on Manchester United, Arsenal and Ronaldo</h2>
  <p><strong>BALE on those Manchester United rumours: </strong>"I did an interview recently and I said I&rsquo;m happy here, I&rsquo;ve got several years left on my contract and I&rsquo;m having a good time. We&rsquo;re winning trophies and I want to stay here." </p>
  <p><strong>BALE on Supporting Arsenal: </strong>"I used to like Arsenal a lot, but when I moved to Tottenham of course I liked them less - but I really liked Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira, those kind of players. They were incredible."</p>
  <h2>'Pogba will never go back to Manchester United' - Pirlo</h2>
  <p>Pogba left United for the Serie A champions in July 2012 after growing frustrated with a lack of first-team opportunities under Sir Alex Ferguson.<BR>
    <BR>
    The 21-year-old immediately became a regular fixture at Juventus and has already won two Serie A titles during his time in Italy.<BR>
  </p>
  <p> "For whatever reasons they [Manchester United] chose not to give him a chance, and that is a mistake they will have to live with now," Pirlo told <EM>Telefoot</EM>.<BR>
  </p>
  <p>"I can&rsquo;t see that he [Pogba] will ever return to Manchester United."<BR>
