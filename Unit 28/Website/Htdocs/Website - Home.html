/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

<p><strong>Arsenal want to tie up €3M for Bielik</strong> [Deal Completed]</p>
<p>Arsenal are confident of completing the purchase Legia Warsaw's midfield prodigy after going back to the Polish club with an <img src="9be6261bd675d83a30b6f6ee5977853d_z.jpg" alt="Krystian Bielik" width="190" height="251" align="right" />increased bid of €3million (£2.4million). Arsene has shown a clear interest for the young midfielder, but he will be viewed as a long-term prospect rather than this season. Arsene is keen in Krystian Bielik's versatility. He can play as an holding-midfielder and as a center back, two areas Arsene is keen to strengthen. Wenger has recently said: &ldquo;He is a young   boy that we follow, yes. We are not very close at the moment [to agree a deal].&rdquo; The midfielder has claimed that he wants to join Arsenal.    </p>
    <p><strong>Chelsea target Jese and Varane</strong></p>
    <p>Despite Jose Mourinho outlining he has no plans to add to his squad, according to Daily Express; Chelsea are looking to bolster their team by &quot;RAIDING&quot; Real Madrid's defender Raphael Varane and foward Jese Rodriquez. Reports suggest that the fee would be around £35 million for the pair. Jose Mourinho is a big fan of Varane, and he has recently stated, &quot;I think he is the best young central defender in the world. Already, I think he's the best.&quot; Jose Mourinho is  a fan of both of them, and now he wants them. Would they both leave?</p>

    <p><strong>Steven Gerrard leaving Liverpool</strong></p>
    <p>Heading over to Liverpool's news, Steven Gerrard has announced that he will be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season. Many speculations are that Gerrard will be playing in the USA for LA Galaxy. Former teammates 
      have paid tribute to him. Gary Lineker also tweeted, &quot;Seems Steven Gerrard is set to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. One of the finest players to have graced the PL. A top, top player.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tottenham agree £5million deal with Swansea for right-back Kyle Naughton </strong></p>
    <p>Tottenham have agreed a deal with Swansea that will see Kyle Naughton move to the Libery Stadium for 5M. The defender is now discussing personal terms ahead of his move. Kyle, 26, is expected to complete his move within 48 hours. Daniel Levy is expected to offload a few players and Kyle is one o them. He believes this will fund new recruits, so it should be in the right direction.</p>
